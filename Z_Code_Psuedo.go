The Geometer and The Grammarian
by Josh Pang

Preface // Read Me

"Welcome to the Geometer and the Grammarian. 
In this novella, we'll be doing a sort of call and response to Pseudo Code, and adding a drop of Synergetics — you won't even notice. 
Good Luck, Have fun!"

// Chapter 1: The Tetrahedrons of Universe
// An Introduction to Phenomenology

The Tetrahedons of Universe eternally regenerate.
Every day the Tetrahedrons expand to Octahedrons, then expand to Icosahedrons, then contract to Octahedrons, then contract to Tetrahedrons.
Their various costumes are expressible by the vector equilibrium.
The Tetrahedrons have 12 degrees of freedom, 6 positive degrees and 6 negative degrees. 

Moral Of The Story: Tetrahedrons are the basic structure in universe. 
In science we call this Synergetics.

// Chapter 2: Geometer Josh
// Why we need synergy

Josh thinks he is 100% enlightened. 
He accepts his stream of consciousness as the moving image of eternity, "Hello little tetrahedron, you can be whatever you like."
He attributes his unusual vanity to non-attachment — "Who am I to be attached to constantly intertransforming tetrahedrons? 
"What's there to be attached to?" 
He smiles as he drinks his delightful beverage: first-things-first. 
Josh is quite a good geometer. 
He has an insane amount of tetrahedrons. 
In fact, Josh is getting a little overwhelmed by his success. 
He needs to stop missing so many tiny 'trivial' details, as they come back to haunt him. 
"Oh little tetrahedrons, what will I do?"
That night, Joshua finds the solution he needs in a dream.

Moral Of The Story: Geometry Josh needs "syntactical incisivity" to manage the plethora of tetrahedrons in his mind. 
In Synergetics, we need syntactical incisivity to communicate to a popular audience.

// Chapter 3: Geometry Josh Dreams A Solution
// An Introduction to Precognitive Dreaming

Joshua is always the last to awaken in his neighborhood.
Every morning he initiates his consciousness begrudgingly. 
Very begrudgingly.
Essentially, Geometry Josh is lazy.
Seemingly lazy, anyway.
The first thing he does every morning is drink coffee. 
After a good cup, he checks the internet for news of peace.
Joshua greets his friend Mr. Computer the same way every morning, "Hello old bean!"
Joshua has greeted each day every day in this way all his life. 
This is his entrance into World Game — "Hello all humanity, I've travelled a long way from the world of dreams. 
I know just what to do today, just give me a little time."
Slowly but surely, Joshua drags himself out of bed and does his hygiene habits. 
He also eats something, because without food he cannot think or speak or act.

In his dreams, Joshua sees the future. 
How does this happen? 
Maybe the nature of time is different than we all suppose. 
Maybe we all are connected at some supraconscious wavelength, and so he just receives word about what we had all previously agreed on.
No one knows, right?

There are two things Geometry Josh knows. 
Sanskrit will become the planetary language. 
And Synergetics will revolutionize all modern science. 

Joshua is very happy when he dreams the future, and he is often impressed about how much his life is able to be normal 
despite such abnormal circumstances. 
Geometry Josh has an intuitive feel in his very body about how things fit together geometrically. 
As a person, he simply does not need to 'know' so many things. 
A lot of his life is just going along with the inexorable tide of evolution.

Joshua has made friends with certain large patterns. 
They are the Kapha Tetrahedron, the Pitta Octahedron, and the Vata Icosahedron. 
It turns out, Ayurveda is really something special. 
Josh simply files Ayurveda under Synergetic knowledge expressed in Sanskrit.

Kapha is a tetrahedron because it is solid and simple. 
Pitta is an octahedron because it is more complex and sharper. 
Vata is an icosahedron because it is simply the most complicated. 
Of all the shapes in our Universe, Vata shapes are the dominant source of all problems until the end of time. 

There are a lot of patterns worth learning about between Sanskrit and Synergetics. 
For example, comparing ॐ to the Vector Equilibrium. 
And precisely mapping the macro-wisdom of Yoga with Synergetics. 
These are some of the projects Geometry Josh will undertake when the world knows peace. 
Until then, there is a real emergency our friend Josh devotes himself to addressing in the mean time.

Moral of the Story: Knowing the farthest futures is fun and fulfilling, call it thrilling; however, until the present moment 
is handled properly, we are anything but with integrity in applying ourselves otherwise. 

// Chapter 4: Joshua Finds Joy In Young Ms. Grammarian's Word Choice
// Unity is plural and at minimum is two

Joshua, being a hardcore geometer, is used to interacting with the strange. 
A lot of his experience is actually pretty psychedlic — "WHOA! Did you SEE that?!"

Young Ms. Grammarian usually has a social following. 
Since Ms. Grammar is the center of so much social attention, she has had to grow into a role of micro-perfection. 
In turn, as everyone notices everything she does, she notices everything anyone does — all within her field of awareness. 
In a flash, Ms. Grammarian knows your whole life when you meet her for the first time. 
And she drops a subtle word or two to point you in the right direction.

Once upon a time, Young Ms. Grammarian and Geometer Josh met each other in the temple on the holy mountain of ambrosia. 
Il Caffé. 
Coffee is an excellent way to communicate micro-incisively, as it heightens the connection to waking reality. 

Their relationship began as a kind of extremely formal first contact between disparate cultures. 
Over time, Geometry Josh began to notice his internal geometry changing — and quite a lot ! 
Energy started to behave in very new ways completely beyond his control. 
This, being a usually competent geometer, at the helm of his own tetrahedroning, gave him pause. 
He took notice. 
And, using the reasoning skills of geometry — deducing an unknown from the known — he figured out what — or who — was 
fiddling with his carefully arranged vector equilibrium!

It turns out, in some mysterious synergy, it was Young Ms. Grammarian and her mere proximity which was turvying all his topsies. 
"Was it an unusual configuration of movement through the 12 degrees of freedom? 
How could this be happening? 
And to me of all people?"

Still assuming he was totally enlightened, Geometry Josh chose to go with the flow, though at times containing his curiosity was difficult.

Little did Josh know this was going to became a major vortex for the foreseeable future.

Moral of the Story: There are two sides to every coin, and — by universal law — no matter how competent and omnipotent and omniscient 
a person may or may not be — there is always always always a blindspot, a 'bizarro realm' in which someone else is inside-out you. 
Everyone sees in 180 degrees. 
No one sees in 360 degrees. 
It takes two to tango, and to get the big picture. 

// Chapter 5: Joshua Chats With Young Ms. Grammarian
// Synergetics explains how English can sound an awful lot like Sanskrit — mostly subconsciously.

Every Saturday for as long as he could remember, Joshua went to visit his best friend the Grammarian. 
On one unusual Saturday, Ms. Grammarian accused Geometry Josh of not knowing everything about Sanskrit — "I thought you knew everything" 
she said, with a tone only she could produce. 
Determined to find out for himself if he did or did not know everything, Geometry Josh embarked on a quest.
Searching through all possible aspects of her challenge was time consuming, yet it was the most important thing to be thinking about.
After studying Italian Grammar, immersing himself in the culture and food and fashion; in the lifestyle and the slowness and the emotion:
even the gesticulations of body language; after all this, a simple conclusion was found.
Though Sanskrit is indeed the most efficient form of communication, the language of enlightenment and the riches of bliss, joy, and ecstasy 
-- even though all of this is true, there is a kind of niché each language and culture has come to be proficient in.
For English, the niché is commerce. 
For Italian, the niché is music. 
All natural languages are a kind of heuristic for particular types of thinking and feeling and doing. 
This was a liberating realization — mathematics is a kind of language with a niché for precise expression. 
It's all just a bunch of language.
Yet, if this were true, why haven't we all eventually stumbled into Sanskrit over so many millenia?
Sanskrit, which is the natural language for humanly-maximum thinking, feeling, and doing.
The language which embraces all nichés. 
The dictionary with the words we've all look for at each stage of life.

Synergetics has an explanation. 
There is a layer beneath the semantics of the spoken word. 
That layer is one of sound harmonics — one well beyond our normal functioning of an ego. 
While our semantics can often be illusory, the underlying sound harmonics is always real. 
There really isn't anything "unreal" — by definition. 
There can be inaccuracies, and pointing to one thing yet meaning another, etc. 
These can sometimes be useful, and a lot of times not. 
The sound we make is always real, and is in fact the stuff of reality. 
They are the tetrahedrons behind our spoken words. 
Though we have an inner monologue, in whatever random language we use, there are tetrahedrons which are running the show, sometimes 
unbeknownst even to us. 
And sound has a direct connection to the elemental tetrahedrons. 
The sounds we make may actually be 'programming' our local environment.
Wouldn't it be nice?
Our words, however, are one step removed.
That is where the very real danger of miscommunication occurs.
Young Ms. Grammarian's challenge brought this to light for our friend Geometry Josh. 
He hopes they will spend a lot of time drinking coffee and being friendly with one another.
The Geometer has a good grasp on the context of reality. 
While the Grammarian has a good grasp on the content of reality. 
Without the Grammarian, the Geometer is effectively-mute — much like Nature herself.
Is Nature un-ergonomic?
Is she having trouble communicating with us?
Without the Geometer, the Grammarian is impotent — full of sound and fury signifying nothing. 
Are humans un-Natural?
Are we having trouble communicating with her?

Between our two friends, the Geometer and the Grammarian, we may one day come to see Sanskrit as everyone's mother tongue, and Synergetics 
as everyone's operating system.
In some ways, geometry is about hardware, and grammar is about software — we need to evolve both concurrently.
And indeed, Sanskrit is the best language for generating the software of culture — the words which color our experience constantly in the 
waking world. 
And indeed, Synergetics is the best way for generating the hardware of culture — geodesic domes for example, also the content of dreams and
thoughts you know.

Geometry Josh is verry happy to have made the acquaintance of a friendly Grammarian.

// Chapter 6: Young Ms. Grammarian Finds A Way To Be Near Her Dear Friend Josh
// Tiptoe, Through the window, By the window, That is where I'll be, Come tiptoe, Through the tulips, With me

Father Time and Mother Nature have a secret to their happy marriage. Humans! Humans create the necessary spice of life to keep their cosmic 
food interesting neverendingly. Geometry Josh has a favorite line from A Midsummer Night Dream. "Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania." 
The ancient words of the fairy king Oberon show engagement in some very advanced Yin and Yang stuff. For all their eternality, 
Shakespeare's royal faeries are all too human.
Direct communication is the key to the tensional integrity of a relationship. Young Ms. Grammarian, being the very powerful linguist that 
she is, had gotten all wrapped up in the subtleties and nuances of feigns and smiles that she had gotten a little lost in her own narrative. 
And Geometry Josh, for all his order and consistency, was the worse at normal direct communication for the overwhelming synchronicity that 
accompanies manipulating the unified field of cosmically hierarchical omni-interrationally-phased, Nuclear-centered, Convergently-
divergently Intertransformable Systems of Geometry: a succession of concentric, 12-around-one, closest-packed spheres, each of a 
tetravolume of five, i.e. of 120 A and B Quanta Modules omniembracing the hierarchy of nuclear event patternings — the synergetics 
isometric view of the isotropic vector matrix and its omnirational, low-order whole number, equilibrious state of the micro-macro cosmic 
limits of the nuclearly unique, symmetrical morphological relativity and its interquantatative, intertranformative, intertransactive 
expansive-contractive, axially rotative, operational field which, as an operationally transformable complex, is conceptualizable only in 
its equilibrious state (-rbf) — is naturally going to stun people. These are a lot of radiant photons for literally anybody.
After years of back and forth, highs and lows — "omnidirectional" — Young Ms. Grammarian lighted upon an insight. While apart, Geometry 
Josh was extrodinarily unusual and easy to misunderstand; when together, Geometry Josh was simple and friendly and fun to be with: almost 
addictive to be around for those who enjoy the certain Sanskrit ethers. The solution was ever so clear. 
In this fictional fairy tale, anyway.
She would simply have to marry him. 
Everyone gets married in children's stories, isn't it, like, a rule?
I don't want to break the rules!

Binded by a ring, they would be complementary opposites. The perfect fit.
Instantaneously she knew what she had to do. Utterly vulnerable, she expressed her experience in a way even Geometry Josh would comprehend. 
She proposed, tying a colored string around his finger. What would Josh do? Of course he accepted Young Ms Grammarians's hand in marriage. 
There's this girl he likes. She's the girl. And, they lived happily ever after do you know?

  -Starboy, The Weekend

So yea, I do generally think women are superior beings in a finite numerical sense. However, in an infinitely regenerative universe sense, 
where equilibrium is achieved only transcendentally, men and women are perfectly equal in their complementarity. While Sanskrit has three 
genders, I am convinced by duality. If I am singularly wrong, that's okay, I live my life already assuming I'm always wrong and she's 
always right. It's simpler that way. Even when she's wrong, she's right. Oh well. 
Being a man is a thing, and I think we guys do have some special bond only we know, and vice versa, and those stuck in the middle. On 
behalf of all men, I formally apologize to womankind for past, present, and future mistakes. Mistakes were made, mistakes are being made, 
and more mistakes will be made. Guys, let's get our shit together. Yeah, it's like that. Can't live with us, can't live without us...
All this to say, there is a synergy that arises which is by definition not predicted by the experiences of men and women apart. There's 
some kind of joy that can only be sparked when opposites attract. Love one another, within this moment there is a total communcation being 
simultaneously transmitted between opposite beings which will take all of time to complete the two-way transfer of Nature's polar energies. 
Given this fact, have a little mercy on each other.
